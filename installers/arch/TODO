had to remove some pkgs from base.list 

only had to enable multilib in pacman.conf

was prompted to replace jack2 which caused base.list install to not work

removed grub update since using systemd boot

commented out runit setup

dont need to install: chronie, cronie?(systemd timers)

#Remember for next install
*make sure to enter in the kernel image names correctly (especially if using zen kernel)
*for systemd boot for PARTUUID get this from blkid
*remember to generate locales (locale-gen)
