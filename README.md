# my-scripts
Some scripts I've written for use on linux

Some of these scripts were copied from other places, I've tried to link to the original location when I did that.

These scripts were written under Wayland, so anything involving graphics will not work under x11.

To use the mangaterm script, you need to be using a terminal that supports sixels (I use foot), and have the program chafa installed.
